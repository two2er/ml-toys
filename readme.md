These are some basic implementations of machine learning models. There is no any optimization on computation performance or storage. Furthermore, only some instances of models, like decision stump AdaBoost, are available, rather than all kinds of base predictor suitable for AdaBoost. This repository only helps to understand the basic idea of machine learning.
