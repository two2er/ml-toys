These are some implementations of basic machine learning models. I wrote them mainly with the help of my undergraduate course textbook, and learned some tricks from others' GitHub repositories to simplify my codes.

There is no any optimization on computing performance or memory. Furthermore, only the basic bones of models are available. The main purpose of this repository is to help me understand the basic concept of famous machine learning models. Wish it can also help you to clarify some most important ideas in this field.
