These are some implementations of basic machine learning models. I wrote them mainly with the help of my undergraduate course textbook, and learned some tricks from others' GitHub repositories to simplify my codes.

There is no optimization on computing performance or memory. Furthermore, only the basic bones of models are available. The main purpose of this repository is to help me understand the basic concept of famous machine learning models. Wish it can also help you to clarify some most important ideas in this field.

**Note:** this repository is under developing. new models will be added continuously. If you find some of existing models do not work, please notice me. It is possible that some models perform strangely on some datasets, maybe because the model could not fit the dataset very well. However, if something ridiculous happens, for example, the loss value increases while fitting, I believe it is a bug of my code. As that the prediction of a machine model doesn't have a 'standard answer', it is maybe hard for me to find out every problem. Please help me complete this repository by making your precious comments.
